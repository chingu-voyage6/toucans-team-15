# "Convoy of hope" clone

## [Chingu Cohorts](https://chingu.io/) - Voyage-6 (Toucans-Team-15)

#### Goal:
Create a responsive, pixel perfect, and functionally complete copy of the "Convoy of hope" website front page.

* We'll attempt to copy the design and function of the page to the best of our abilities.
* If there's some function we can't copy, we'll leave a placeholder.
* Also, we can add to or modify the design if we feel we can do better.

#### Technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
  * Flexbox
  * CSS Grid   
  * Bootstrap (if needed)
* JavaScript    
  * jQuery (if needed)

#### Team Guidelines:

**Code:**

* CamelCase for id's
* kebab-case for Classes
* Use idâ€™s for JavaScript
* Use classes for CSS
* Comments where appropriate for code clarification

**Trello Flow:**

* Split each user story into technical tasks on Trello, under `Tasks`.
* Assign yourself to a task and move card to `In-Development` column.
* When work is complete and you made a PR move card to `To-Review` column.
* After the PR approved and the branch was merged to `Development`, move the card to the `Done` column. Make sure all the subtasks in the checklist are checked.

**GitHub Flow:**

* `Development` branch is the default branch.
* For each functionality/task - work on a separate branch.
* The branch will be merged to `Development` by one of the other team members.
* At the end of each sprint we will merge `Development` to `Master`.
